JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010.Originally called Oak which was designed for use in embedded chips in consumer electronic appliances.

In 1995 Oak was renamed Java , it was redesigned for developing Web applications. It was developed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton. Java is a simple programming language. Writing, compiling and debugging a program is easy in java.  It helps to create modular programs and reusable code.

### Java Terminology

Before we start learning Java, lets get familiar with common java terms.

#### The Java Language Specification, API and IDE

- Java syntax is defined in the Java language specification, and the Java library is defined in the Java API.

- The JDK is the software for developing and running Java programs. 

- An IDE is an integrated development environment for rapidly developing programs.

Computer languages have strict rules of usage. If you do not follow the rules when writing a program, the computer will not be able to understand it. The Java language specification and the Java API define the Java standards.

The Java language specification  is a technical definition of the Java programming languageâ€™s syntax and semantics. You can find the complete Java language specification at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/ .

The application program interface (API) , also known as library , contains predefined classes and interfaces for developing Java programs. The API is still expanding. You can view and download the latest version of the Java API at http://download.java.net/jdk8/docs/api/ .

 Java is a full-fledged and powerful language that can be used in many ways. It comes in three editions:

- Java Standard Edition (Java SE)  to develop client-side applications. The applications

can run standalone or as applets running from a Web browser.

- Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)  to develop server-side applications, such as Java

servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and JavaServer Faces (JSF).

- Java Micro Edition (Java ME)  to develop applications for mobile devices, such as cell phones.

This book uses Java SE to introduce Java programming. Java SE is the foundation upon which all other Java technology is based. There are many versions of Java SE. The latest,Java SE 9, is used in this book. Oracle releases each version with a Java Development Toolkit (JDK).  For Java SE 9, the Java Development Toolkit is called JDK 1.9  (also known as Java 9 or JDK 9 ).
